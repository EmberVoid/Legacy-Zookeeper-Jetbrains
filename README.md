# Zookeeper-Jetbrains
## _First Python Project_

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

## Learning outcomes

There are 4 stages with various Python topics on each one

- Stage 1-4 - Rush into print  
    -- Overview of the basic program, printing and Multi-line programs 
- Stage 2-4 - Show me an animal  
    -- PEP 8 - Naming Conventions and code standard
    -- How to add _comments_
    -- Basic data type (Strings, int, float)
- Stage 3-4 - What's inside  
    -- Defining a variable and assigning values
    -- Taking and managing user inputs (input())
    -- Lists and Indexes
- Stage 4-4 - Sustainable care + error handling  
    -- Integer arithmetic and basic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division, integer divission)
    -- Comparisons operators
    -- If statement, While Loops and Boolean Logic
    -- Added basic error handling (try, except, IndexError and ValueError)
